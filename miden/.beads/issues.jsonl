Deploys vanilla kurtosis-cdk (includes OP-Geth/OP-Node L2 we don't need)\n2. Manually adds: miden-node, miden-proxy, nginx L2-forwarder containers\n3. Truncates bridge Postgres tables to force fresh L2 sync\n4. Reconfigures aggkit-bridge container (sed-patches L2URL → forwarder)\n5. Reconfigures zkevm-bridge-service (sed-patches L2URLs → forwarder)\n6. Stops/recreates aggkit-bridge with modified config mounted as volume\n7. Stops/recreates aggsender with modified config + aggoracle component\n8. Adds network alias miden-l2-forwarder for DNS compat\n\nThis is ~600 lines of fragile post-provisioning shell that breaks when container names change (already happened with miden-infra namespace rename).\n\n## Target State\n\nA Kurtosis params YAML (or custom package) that:\n\n### Must Have\n- Deploys L1 (lighthouse/geth/anvil) + agglayer + bridge contracts (same as vanilla CDK)\n- Does NOT deploy OP-Geth/OP-Node (we don't use Optimism L2)\n- Includes miden-node service (image: miden-infra/miden-node:agglayer-v0.1, port 57291)\n- Includes miden-proxy service (image: miden-infra/miden-proxy, port 8546, env vars: CHAIN_ID, MIDEN_RPC_URL, BRIDGE_FAUCET_ID, BRIDGE_ADDRESS, LISTEN_PORT)\n- Includes nginx L2 forwarder (or configures bridge to hit proxy directly on 8545)\n- Configures aggkit-bridge with L2URL pointing to proxy/forwarder from the start\n- Configures zkevm-bridge-service with L2URLs pointing to proxy/forwarder\n- Configures aggsender+aggoracle with correct L2URL and TargetChainType=EVM\n- No post-provisioning database truncation needed (fresh deploy = clean state)\n\n### Nice to Have\n- pgweb container for bridge DB browsing\n- Parameterized bridge faucet ID / bridge address\n- Health checks on all services\n\n## Key Details\n\n### Container Network\nAll on kurtosis network (kt-cdk-miden). DNS via container names.\n\n### Miden Proxy Env Vars\n- CHAIN_ID=2\n- MIDEN_RPC_URL=http://miden-node:57291\n- MIDEN_STORE_PATH=/app/data/miden-client\n- BRIDGE_FAUCET_ID=0x000000000000000000000000000001\n- BRIDGE_ADDRESS=(from contract deployment)\n- LISTEN_PORT=8546\n\n### Bridge Config Changes (vs vanilla CDK)\n- L2URL: http://op-el-1-op-geth-op-node-001:8545 → http://miden-proxy:8545 (or forwarder)\n- RPCURL: same redirect\n- TargetChainType: must be \"EVM\" (uncommented)\n\n### Approach Options\n1. **kurtosis-cdk params file**: Use the existing CDK package's parameterization to disable OP components and add custom services. Check if kurtosis-cdk supports additional_services or custom L2 config.\n2. **Fork/overlay**: Create a thin Kurtosis package that imports kurtosis-cdk and overrides the L2 layer.\n3. **Standalone package**: Full custom Kurtosis package (most work but cleanest).\n\nOption 1 is preferred if kurtosis-cdk supports enough parameterization.\n\n## Files\n- Current script: scripts/e2e-test.sh\n- Kurtosis CDK: https://github.com/0xPolygon/kurtosis-cdk\n- Config snapshots: scripts/.aggkit-config/, scripts/.aggkit-001-config/","notes":"Implemented miden-cdk Kurtosis package that provisions Miden bridge infrastructure without post-hoc patching.

{"id":"mi-m40g","title":"Web UI for agglayer deposits to Miden","description":"attached_molecule: mi-wisp-guv7\nattached_at: 2026-01-29T10:25:44Z\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\n## Goal\n\nBuild a simple web UI for sending agglayer deposits (bridging ETH from L1 to Miden). Deploy it as part of the Kurtosis stack.\n\n## Design Reference\n\nLook and feel inspired by Gateway dashboard (~/Desktop/svg.png): clean card-based layout, purple accent color, sidebar or top nav, modern/minimal aesthetic. But this is a SIMPLE single-purpose dApp — deposit form, not a full dashboard.\n\n## Functionality\n\nMirrors what `scripts/send-deposit.sh` does, but from the browser:\n\n1. **Connect Wallet** — MetaMask, Opera, Brave, or any injected EIP-1193 provider\n2. **Pick Recipient** — Input field for Miden destination address (the 15-byte hex AccountId)\n3. **Pick Amount** — Input field for ETH amount (human-readable, e.g. \"0.1\")\n4. **Send Deposit** — Calls `bridgeAsset()` on the bridge contract via the connected wallet\n\n### bridgeAsset call details\n```solidity\nbridgeAsset(\n  uint32 destinationNetwork,    // 2 (Miden)\n  address destinationAddress,   // Miden AccountId converted: prepend 5 zero bytes to 15-byte ID\n  uint256 amount,               // In wei\n  address token,                // 0x0000...0000 (native ETH)\n  bool forceUpdateGlobalExitRoot, // true\n  bytes permitData              // 0x\n)\n```\n\nThe bridge contract address should be read from environment/config (default: `0xc8cbebf950b9df44d987c8619f092bea980ff038`). The UI should send ETH as `msg.value` along with the call.\n\n### Only native token (ETH) for now\nNo ERC-20 token picker needed. Just ETH.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\nKeep it simple:\n- Single-page app (vanilla JS + HTML/CSS, or lightweight framework like Vite+React if preferred)\n- ethers.js or viem for wallet connection and contract interaction\n- No backend needed — pure client-side dApp\n\n## Kurtosis Integration\n\nPackage the UI as a Docker container (nginx serving static files) and add it to the Kurtosis params/config so it deploys alongside the other services. Expose on a known port (e.g. 3000 or 8080).\n\n## Key Files for Reference\n- Existing deposit script: `scripts/send-deposit.sh`\n- Docker setup: `docker-compose.yml`\n- Kurtosis config: check for params.yml or similar\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] UI connects to injected wallet (MetaMask etc.)\n- [ ] User can enter Miden recipient address and ETH amount\n- [ ] Clicking \"Deposit\" sends bridgeAsset tx via wallet\n- [ ] Shows tx hash / confirmation after send\n- [ ] Deployed as container in Kurtosis stack\n- [ ] Styling matches Gateway-inspired clean look (purple accents, cards, modern)","notes":"Implemented web UI for agglayer deposits. Single-page dApp (vanilla JS + ethers.js) with wallet connection, Miden address input, ETH amount, and bridgeAsset() call. Packaged as nginx Docker container. Added to Kurtosis stack (miden_services.star) and docker-compose.yml.
