Conversational Content Assistant\n- Chat interface overlaying the workspace\n- Simulated AI responses for content creation requests\n- Natural language input for commands like \"Draft a blog post about Q3 results\"\n\n### 2. In-Context AI Editor\n- Live website preview with \"AI Edit Mode\" toggle\n- Click any text/image/section to get AI suggestions tooltip\n- Side panel logging changes with undo capability\n- Contextual overlays for suggestions\n\n### 3. Trust \u0026 Compliance Dashboard\n- Visible \"Trust Score\" shield in top nav (green/yellow/red states)\n- Gamified compliance checklist (e.g., \"95/100 points\")\n- Drill-down view showing specific issues (missing alt text, meta descriptions)\n- Celebratory animations when hitting milestones\n\n### 4. Spatial Content Canvas (stretch goal)\n- Infinite canvas showing site structure as cards/nodes\n- Pan and zoom navigation\n- Visual clustering of related pages\n\n## Tech Stack\n- Pure frontend (React/Vue/vanilla JS - your choice)\n- Mock data for all AI responses\n- Focus on UX polish and interactions\n\n## Key Interactions to Demo\n- Chat with AI assistant → see simulated response\n- Toggle AI Edit Mode → click elements → see suggestion popups\n- View Trust Score → drill into compliance items\n- Mark compliance items complete → score updates\n\n## Not In Scope\n- Actual AI/LLM integration\n- Backend/database\n- Authentication\n- Real content management\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Demonstrates the \"wow factor\" of AI-first CMS UX\n- Feels like chatting with a colleague, not using software\n- Compliance feels empowering, not burdensome","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"cms/polecats/rust","created_at":"2026-01-27T18:21:21.301282+01:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-27T18:57:41.539675+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-27T18:57:41.539675+01:00","close_reason":"Merged to main"}
