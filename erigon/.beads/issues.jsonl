If not, escalate to Mayor:\n```bash\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e needs help\" -m \"\u003cdetails\u003e\"\n```\nArchive after handling (escalated or resolved):\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmessage-id\u003e\n```\n\n**HANDOFF**:\nRead predecessor context. Continue from where they left off.\nArchive after absorbing context:\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmessage-id\u003e\n```\n\n**SWARM_START**:\nMayor initiating batch polecat work. Initialize swarm tracking.\n```bash\n# Parse swarm info from mail body: {\"swarm_id\": \"batch-123\", \"beads\": [\"bd-a\", \"bd-b\"]}\nbd create --wisp --title \"swarm:\u003cswarm_id\u003e\" --description \"Tracking batch: \u003cswarm_id\u003e\" --labels swarm,swarm_id:\u003cswarm_id\u003e,total:\u003cN\u003e,completed:0,start:\u003ctimestamp\u003e\n```\nArchive after creating swarm tracking wisp:\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmessage-id\u003e\n```\n\n**Hygiene principle**: Archive messages after they're fully processed.\nKeep only: active work, unprocessed requests.
