{"id":"de-38u","title":"Mock clawdbot control using OpenClaw Audit Proxy spec","description":"attached_molecule: de-wisp-avn\nattached_at: 2026-02-04T19:50:00Z\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\nReplace the simple MCP bot agent with a clawdbot control interface based on the OpenClaw Audit Proxy spec.\n\n**Spec**: ~/Downloads/openclaw-audit-proxy-spec.docx (copied to repo)\n\n**Key Concepts from Spec**:\nThe audit proxy has 3 interception layers:\n1. LLM API Proxy - intercepts all model requests/responses (HTTP reverse proxy)\n2. Gateway WebSocket Tap - captures channel messages, session events, node ops\n3. Tool Execution Wrapper - wraps shell commands, file ops, browser actions\n\nEach produces AuditEvent records with:\n- Hash-chained tamper-evident logging (SHA-256)\n- Structured schema: seq, id, timestamp, layer, category, sessionKey, agentId, tool, input/output, status, duration, meta\n- Fail-closed mode (block action if logging fails)\n- SQLite WAL storage with export sinks\n\n**What to Build (Mock/Demo)**:\n- Replace the simple MCP bot control in the MSF2 frontend/agent with a clawdbot control interface\n- Show real-time audit events from the agent (tool calls, LLM requests, actions taken)\n- Implement the AuditEvent display in the UI (filterable by category, tool, status)\n- Mock the 3 interception layers with simulated events or wire to the actual MCP agent's actions\n- Show hash chain integrity visualization\n- Support fail-closed/open/degraded mode toggle in UI\n\n**Current Agent**: `agent/` directory, uses MCP protocol\n**Frontend**: `frontend/` (Next.js at :3000)\n**Docker**: msf2-agent container\n\nThis is a DEMO/MOCK implementation showing the concept, not the full production audit proxy.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"declaw/polecats/slit","created_at":"2026-02-04T20:48:45.126402+01:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-02-04T21:16:37.493441+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-04T21:16:37.493441+01:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"de-38u","depends_on_id":"de-wisp-avn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-04T20:58:32.285661+01:00","created_by":"mayor"}],"comments":[{"id":2,"issue_id":"de-38u","author":"mayor","text":"Completed by Mayor.
